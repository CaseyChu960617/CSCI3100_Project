# Urge - A online learning platform - CSCI3100-Project
- Group: A8
- Project name: Urge

## Purpose: 
- To develop a multi-functional online learning platform for CUHK students to LEARN and SHARE KNOWLEDGE. 

## 3 Key-functions of the website:

1. TUTORIAL POSTING AND BROWSING SYSTEM
- Urge allows all CUHK students and professors to upload their teaching materials online to share knowledge.
- The main difference between normal teaching and Urge is we encourage a bottom to top knowledge sharing.
- Urge believes enhancing creativity and knowledge is not limited by teaching but by sharing no matter you are a expert or not.

2. DISCUSSION POSTING AND BROWSING SYSTEM
- Urge allows all CUHK students and professors to answer questions based on discussion threads.
- Everyone is able to learn from the discussion and further discuss through the topic.
- Urge believes raising questions and discuss about issues are the necessary way to consolidate our knowledge.

3. REALTIME CHATTING SYSTEM
- Urge encourages users to have real-time chatting to discuss their interested topic.
- Urge believes real-time chatting systems provide a more flexible way for peers to discuss non-technical topics such as career path, self-learning materials, exchanges, etc.
- This sytem allows an all-rounded service provision for peers to share their personal experiences.
